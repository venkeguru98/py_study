1. Write a program that creates a dictionary representing a person's contact information. 
The dictionary should include keys for "name", "email", and "phone". 
Assign values to these keys and then print out the contact information.

person_info = {

    "name" : "venkat,
    "email": "venkeguru98@gmail.com"
    "phone": 9865254571
}

print("information")
print("NAME :", person_info["name"])
print("EMAIL :", person_info["email"])
print("PHONE :", person_info["phone"])

2. Write a program that creates an empty dictionary to store information about a car. 
Ask the user to input the car's make, model, and year. Store these details in the dictionary 
and then update the year value to the current year.
Finally, print the updated dictionary.

car_dict{ }

#getting input from the user

make = input("Enter the make :")
model = input("Enter the model :")
year = input("enter the year :")

car_dict["make"] = make
car_dict["model"] = model
car_dict["year"] = year

print(car_dict)

current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year

car_dict["year"] = current_year
print(car_dict)

3.Write a program that creates a dictionary representing a shopping list. 
The dictionary should have items as keys and quantities as values. 
Ask the user to input items and quantities until they enter "done" as the item. 
Then, print out the shopping list in a nicely formatted way.

shopping_list = {}

#getting input from the user 

while True 

    item = input ("Enter the Input or done once over : )

    if item.lower == "done"

   break:

   quantity = input(int("Enter the quantity :"))

print("\nshopping LIST")
for (item,quantity ) in shopping_list.items():
    print( f" {item},{quantity}
    )

Write a program that creates a dictionary representing a person's weekly schedule. 
Each key in the dictionary should represent a day of the week (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday") 
and the value should be a list of tasks for that day. 
Use a loop to iterate over the dictionary and print out the schedule for each day.

schedule_dict = {

    "Monday : ["task1","task2","task3"]
    "Tuesday :["task1","task2","task"]
    "Wednesday" : ["task1","task2,"task3]

}

for day,tasks in schedule_dict.items():
    print(f"{day}")
    for task in task :
       print(f" {task}")
    print()


Write a program that creates a dictionary of words and their corresponding lengths. 
Ask the user to input a sentence, split it into words, 
and store each word in the dictionary along with its length. 
Finally, print out the dictionary.

words_dict = {}

#getting input from the usesr 

sentence = input("Enter the word :")

#splitting the sentence into words 

words = sentence.split()

for word in words
    word_dict[word] = len(word)

#print the dict 

print("word lengths")
for word,length in word_dict.items():
    print(f"{word},{length})



Write a program that takes a sentence as input and counts the frequency of each word in the sentence. 
The program should store the word frequencies in a dictionary where the words are the keys and 
the frequencies are the values. Finally, print out the dictionary.


word_frequency ={}

sentence = input("Enter the Sentence :")

words = sentence.split()

for word in words:
    if word in word_frequency:
       word_frequency[word] += 1
    else 
       word_freq[word] =1  

#print out the dict 
 for word,freq in word_frequency.items()
     print(f"{word}:{frequency}")
     print()
