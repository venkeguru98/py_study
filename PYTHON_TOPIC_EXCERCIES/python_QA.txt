#SIMPLE STB PROJECTS USING PYTHON 

1.Remote Control Simulation: Create a simple program that simulates the functionality of a remote control for an STB. This can be done using Python's GUI libraries, such as Tkinter or PyQt.

2.Channel Scanner: Develop a program that can scan for available TV channels and store the channel information in a database.

3.Electronic Program Guide (EPG): Create an EPG that displays a schedule of upcoming TV shows and movies. The program can retrieve the schedule information from a database or an online source.

4.Media Player: Build a simple media player that can play video and audio files stored on the STB. The program can use Python's built-in libraries, such as vlc or pygame, to handle the media playback.

5.Channel Zapper: Create a program that can change TV channels by simulating the button presses of a remote control. The program can use Python's serial library to communicate with the STB.
