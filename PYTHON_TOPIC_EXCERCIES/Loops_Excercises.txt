1.Write a program that prints out the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

OUTPUT : [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
logic : decalare a ist with the  value and in the loop ilerate the values and print the list 

mylist = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]   #using for loop
for i in range(len(mylist)):
     print(mylist[i])

2.Write a program that prints out the even numbers from 1 to 20 using a for loop.

EX 1 : mylist = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

for i in range (len(mylist)) 
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print [f"{i} EVEN "]
    else:
        print (f"{i} ODD")

EX 2 : Logic using the range of value giving 1 to 20 

for i in range (1,20):
    if i % 2 == 0:
       print(i)

3.Write a program that prints out the odd numbers from 1 to 20 using a while loop.

Logic : asiing the ileratro value from 1 to 20 and condition for odd and if satisfy the condition print the nums 

i = 1
while i < = 20:
   if i % 2 != 0:
   print(i)
i=i+1

4.Write a program that takes a list of integers and prints out the sum of all the numbers using a for loop.

EX 1 : LOGIC : adding the values in the list using SUM Keyword 

list = [ 10,20,30,40,50]
sum of list = list.sum()
print(sum of list)

EX 2 : USing for loop 

LOGIC : initizalie a varible sum = 0 

list = [1,1,1,1,]
sum = 0 
for i in list :
    sum = sum + i 
print("the value of the sum",sum)


5.Write a program that takes a list of strings and prints out each string in reverse order using a for loop.

EX 1 : Reverse the order of the string in the list 
list = ["venke","Guru","venkat]
print(list[::-1])

EX 2 : Reverse the each string using for loop 

list = ["venke","Guru","venkat]
for i in list :
    print(list[::-1])


6.Write a program that takes a string and prints out the number of vowels in the string using a for loop.

list = [ "venke","guru"]

vowels = ["a","e","i","o","u"]

for i in list :
    if i in vowels:
       print("the value of the list ",i)


7.Write a program that takes a list of integers and prints out only the numbers that are divisible by 3 using a for loop.


list = [10,20,30]

for i in list :
    if i % 3 == 0:
    print(f"{i} divisbile by 3)


Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out the largest number using a for loop.

list = [ 10,20,30,40,50]

maximumvaluae = list[0]

for i in list :
    if i > maximum value 
    maxiumum valuae = i 
print("the maximum value is",maximumvalue)

9.Write a program that takes a list of strings and prints out only the strings that start with a vowel using a for loop.

LOGIC : firstly iniliaze the value of the list and intlizae a varibale vowels and check for each word in ths 
list if it starts with a vowel and print the word 

list = ["venke","amma","Guru"]

vowel = ['a','e','i','o','u']

for i in list :
    if i[0].lower() in vowel:
    print("the words in vowel",i) 


Write a program that takes a string and prints out each character of the string in a separate line using a for loop.

value = "venkat"

for i in value:
 print(i)
