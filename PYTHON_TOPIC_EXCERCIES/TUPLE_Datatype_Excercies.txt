Create two tuples containing the x and y coordinates of two points. Write a function that takes these two tuples as arguments and  
calculates the distance between the two points using the distance formula: sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).

import math

point1 = (1,2)
point2 = (3,4)

def calculatedistance(point1,point2):
    x1,y1 = point1
    x2,y2 = point2

    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)

#calling the function 

result = calculatedistance(point1,point2)
print(f"the Result of the following {point1} and {point2} is {result:}")

Create a tuple containing the temperatures (in Celsius) of a particular city for each day of a week. Write a program to convert these temperatures to Fahrenheit and store them in a new tuple. Print both tuples.
