1. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list.

list = [ 10,20,30]
sumlist = sum(lists)
print(sumlist) 

output = 60


2. Write a Python program to find the largest number in a list.

logic 1: First sort the value of the list --> it will sort from the order ascnedning to descedning 
        Then using index acess the list largest value 

list = [20,10,40,10,50,5]
sortthelist = sort.(list)
print(sortthelist)
print(sortthelist[6])

Logic 2 : use the keyword max for finding the maximum of the values in the list

list = [20,10,40,10,50,5]
maxvalue = max(list)
print(maxvalue)

3. Write a Python program to find the second largest number in a list.

logic : first sorrt the value in the givne list and access the value by indexing the value from the back 

list = [20,10,89,10]
sortthelist=sort(list)
print(sortthelist[-2])

4.Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list

logic : convert the list value to the set by usning the set key word 

list = [10,5,10,5]
newlist = set(list)
print(newlist)

5.Write a Python program to find the common elements between two lists.

logic : covert the list to the set using the set keyword and compare the two set value with the AND operator 

list1= [10,20,30]
list2= [30,40,50]

newcommomlist = (set(list1) & set(list2))
print(newcommomlist)

6. Write a Python program to concatenate two lists.

logic : to concentate two of the lists use the addition operator between the lists 

list1 = [10,20,30]
list2 = [40,50,60]

newlist = list1 + list2
print(newlist)

7. Write a Python program to check if a list is empty or not.

Logic : use the if condition for checking the wheather the list has value using the if not 

list = [10,20,30]
if not in list:
   print(value not in list )
else:
   print(value there in list )

8. Write a Python program to reverse a list.

Logic 1: use the keyword to reverse the given value of the list 

list = [10,20,30,40,50]
list.reverse()
print(list)

logic 2: indexing the value by giving the step as -1 

list = [10,20,30,40,50]
list[::-1]
print(list)

logic 3 : list comphrension ( need to learn )
